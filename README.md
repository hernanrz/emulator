===
A server emulator written in PHP

Q: *A server what?*

A: It reads a file and then listens on a port, **any** request made on that port will get the file's contents as the response, regardless of the request body (This part will be changed later on)

Q: *Why?*

A: I had two motivations for this project, I needed a tool that could do this, I wanted to try out a few new things I learned in PHP
