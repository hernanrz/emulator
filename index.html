      Emu is a super simple server emulator written in <i title="The best programming language to be invented since BASIC">PHP</i>.
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>Why is it called an emulator?</b>
        <br />
        Because <s>I couldn't think of a better name</s> it creates a server, but it will only serve whatever data you provide to it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>How is this useful at all?</b>
        <br />
        I created this because some of the code in a different project makes several requests to a local API, so instead of installing another server I can just run Emu and test my code without much hassle.
